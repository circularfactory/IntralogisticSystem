<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown"><p>This ontology accompanyis an intralogistic system developed for the circular factory. The intralogistic system plays a central role in picking, transporting, and manipulating products and components on the circular factory shop floor. Since the material flow of both new and reused components is inherently uncertain and may require on-the-fly adjustments based on the outcomes of disassembly or diagnostic processes, the system must be highly adaptable and flexible.</p>
