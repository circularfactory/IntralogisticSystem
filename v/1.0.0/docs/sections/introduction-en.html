<span class="markdown"><p><img src="sections/images/system_overview.png"/> In the era of Industry 4.0, data-driven intelligence is a fundamental enabler of autonomous production and decision-making systems. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS), as summarized by [1] and adapted from [2], are networked systems composed of autonomous and cooperative elements that interact in situation-dependent ways across all levels of production. These systems enhance real-time decision-making, enable adaptation to unforeseen conditions, and support continuous evolution over time. Building on this foundation, the concept of the circular factory raises the demands on CPPS beyond those of tra- ditional linear production systems [3]. A circular factory is designed to manufacture the latest product generation using a variable proportion of reused components from previous product generations. This approach, while advancing sustainability and resource efficiency, introduces a high degree of uncertainty into the production process - particularly with respect to the availability, timing, and quality of reused components. As a result, the associated processes and the resources on which they are executed require greater flexibility, robustness, and real-time responsiveness. To address these challenges, CPPS require a shared knowledge representation that enables both horizontal and vertical integration, facilitating system-wide semantic interoperability [4],[5]. A formalized knowledge model is essential for harmonizing the dynamic interactions among physical resources, digital twins, and planning systems.</p>
<p>The intralogistic system plays a central role in picking, transporting, and manipulating products and components on the circular factory shop floor. Since the material flow of both new and reused components is inherently uncertain and may require on-the-fly adjustments based on the outcomes of disassembly or diagnostic processes, the system must be highly adaptable and flexible [6]. Figure 1 pro- vides an overview on the proposed system.</p>
<p>On the most abstract level, the system consists of a fleet of mobile robots that can freely navigate the shop floor. These robots can mount different types of self-contained modules, either to reposition the modules within the factory or to extend their own capabilities for carrying out various material handling processes. On a control level, and aligned with the concepts of the <a href="https://w3id.org/circularfactory/Core">Circular Factory Core Ontology</a>, intralogistic tasks generated by the production control system are auctioned by an Auctioneer. The auction process results in executable intralogistic operations ,which define the concrete actions to be performed.</p>
